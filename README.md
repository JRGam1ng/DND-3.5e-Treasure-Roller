# DND-3.5e-Treasure-Roller
Treasure roller (only up to level 20 and doesn't automatically roll the minor, medium and major magical items)

READ ME:

This treasure roller was created for my SO/DM of our DnD 3.5e Campaign.  All formulas were based on this site: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/treasure.htm

There are images in the code that are not included.  They aren't inlcuded as I do not own the images I used.  You can create your own or use the code without images, though that may mess with the formatting a bit.

It will automatically roll for gems/art pieces, and list the names and worth, but does not roll the magical items (except mundane) as there are many lists of different possibilities for magical items.
